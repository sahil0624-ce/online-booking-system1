Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

üöÄ Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure of the web page.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all interactive functionalities, dynamic content generation, and form handling.

üìÅ File Structure
The project is organized into three main files:

.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js

index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the booking page. It links to the Tailwind CSS CDN, Google Fonts, and your custom style.css and script.js files.

style.css: Contains all the custom CSS rules for styling the application, including custom classes and overrides to enhance the Tailwind CSS base.

script.js: Houses all the JavaScript logic responsible for date navigation, rendering time slots, handling slot selection, form submission, and managing the custom message box. It includes an in-memory data store for mock booking data.
